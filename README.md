# Developer notes
The `PlayerMixin` is used for serverside messages using the player name (join, death, achievement gain, etc.). `ClientboundPlayerInfoUpdatePacketEntryMixin` will send the player the _display name_ we want, but we can't send a modifed `GameProfile` because it exceeds the packet limit. This display name is used for the tablist, but not nametags.
